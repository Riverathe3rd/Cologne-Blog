#Cologne Blog#
##Introduction##
The cologne blog is a project that started off as a simple project for my web development class that I'm continuing to develop during the summer.
Using colognes purchased from the subscription service <a href"https://www.scentbird.com/">Scentbird,</a> I add them to my blog on a monthly basis and review how I like them.
##Future Plans##
*link all colognes to either scentbird or their official website link*
*build a review system. Maybe small colognes in place of stars?*
