<h1>Cologne Blog</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The cologne blog is a project that started as a simple project for my web development class that I'm continuing to develop during the summer.
Using colognes purchased from the subscription service <a href"https://www.scentbird.com/">Scentbird,</a> I add them to my blog every month and review how I like them.
<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<ul>
  <li>link all colognes to either Scentbird or their official website link</li>
  <li>build a review system. Maybe small colognes in place of stars?</li>
  <li>add reviews to current colognes</li>
</ul>
